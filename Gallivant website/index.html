        <p class="story">
          What do two grad students studying literature know about international
          travel? Quite a lot, it turns out! In our research, we frequently work
          with librarians and guides who safeguard primary source documents such
          as diary entries, newspaper clippings, etc. These people are extremely
          knowledgeable and passionate about their subjects. Through our work,
          we realized that it's these people - the curators and librarians - who
          bring to life the stories of their subjects - the artists and writers
          who created the culture of the cities where they lived and worked. We
          connect you with these research librarians and local guides - and we
          also set up lodging and travel, if you need it! We can create a tour
          package specifically for you based on your needs and interests -
          bespoke tours are our specialty!

              Battlo, La Perdera, and Parc Guell, but we'll also take you
              outside of the city to Montserrat, the heart of Catalonia, where
              you'll experience the natural landscape that inspired Gaudi -
              immideiately recognizable in the towers of the Sagrada Familia.

              Haussmann's on the streets of Paris. Stroll along the boulevards
              like a true flaneur as we show you all the spots that meant the
              most to prominent French writers and thinkers, as well as
              displaced Americans (Fitzgerald, Hemingway, etc.) who made their
              home there in the 1920s.

              Though he spent a great deal of time in Paris in the 20s, Joyce is
              remembered for his evocative portraits of his home city: Dublin.
              We take a stroll through his streets, as well as those of other
              prominent literary Irishmen such as Oscar Wilde, Jonathan Swift,
              and Samuel Beckett. A trip to Kilmainham Gaol helps us to draw a
              line from the past to the present and understand the work of
              contemporary Irish writers and playwrights such as Sally Rooney
              and Enda Walsh.

              tradition is strong, as you'll see at the Epidaurus. Finally, we
              conclude in the Greek islands, the heart of the country and the

              and its heart.

              vast and exciting city. We'll explore the nearby Coyoacán district
              and dive deep into history at the Museo Nacional de Antropología.
              No visit would be complete without a visit to the magical
              Xochimilco. Throughout it all, we'll dive deep into this country
              rich in folklore and mythology, while tracing its influence on
